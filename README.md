**Lab 6**

Lab 6 in the CIND 123 course at Ryerson University was designed to teach us how to create and determine when to use three different types of Distributions: Binomial, Hypergeometric, Poisson. Each folder describes the difference between distributions and why each were used.



**Binomial Distribution**

A **binomial distribution** can be thought of as simply the probability of a SUCCESS or FAILURE (Yes or No, 1 or 0 etc.) outcome in an experiment or survey that is repeated multiple times.

**Hypergeometric Distribution**

**Hypergeometric Distribution** is the probability distribution that describes the probability of successes from a random draw of an object with specified features without replacement. This distribution occurs within a finite population size that contains certain amounts of objects with that feature.

**Poisson Distribution**

**Poisson distribution** shows how many times an event is likely to occur within a specified period of time.



To begin I would recommend reading the PDF file that explains each question and why it is done.
