#Poisson distribution

#Question 1: If there are twelve cars crossing a bridge per minute on average, find the probability of having seventeen or more cars crossing the bridge in a particular minute.  

#Steps : 

#1) Investigate the ppois() distribution function using R's help function. 2) From the question decide the right values to be set for x and lambda and the lower.tail 3) Calculate the probability of having sixteen or less cars crossing the bridge in a particular minute. 

# The probability of having sixteen or less cars crossing the bridge in a particular minute is given by the function ppois. 
ppois(16, lambda=12)   # lower tail 

# Hence the probability of having seventeen or more cars crossing the bridge in a minute is in the upper tail of the probability density function. 
ppois(16, lambda=12, lower=FALSE)   # upper tail 

# The probability of having seventeen or more cars crossing the bridge for any given minute is 10.1%
